                    Hello, friend. Welcome to my space!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm Shraddha, a 22-year-old Computer Science Engineer from Bangalore, India. I like keeping a record of my work, hence I decided to build this web portfolio. I will be using this site to showcase my projects, skills, and professional experience. I included a blog section that will cater to my interest in writing.

                    I wrote my first program in my freshman year of college and fell in love with it! Programming fundamentally is about building solutions to problems. End of the day, being able to create something that did not exist earlier that morning is in itself satisfying and brings me sheer joy. Coding has also given me the ability to focus on minute details. After starting to code, I have been paying attention to the slightest details like never before! I'm also a data science enthusiast. I have explored several areas in data science during college. In the long run, I aspire to build software that can solve real-world problems, incorporating the power of Artificial Intelligence. When I'm not coding, you will find me doodling or watching documentaries. I sometimes read. My current favorite is Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari.
