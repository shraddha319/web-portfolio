# Client side and server side rendering

The traditional method for fetching and rendering content on the browser has always been server-side rendering. It was the most suitable method back then since most content on the web were static text and images, with very minimal user interactivity. Over the years, web applications have become more complex and provide a wide range of user interactions. They are no longer static sites, but rather full end applications that can be used to shop, submit forms, chat, etc.  

## what is server and client side rendering?
> _Server rendering generates the full HTML for a page on the server in response to navigation. This avoids additional round-trips for data fetching and templating on the client, since it’s handled before the browser gets a response. Client-side rendering (CSR) means rendering pages directly in the browser using JavaScript. All logic, data fetching, templating and routing are handled on the client rather than the server._ \

When we visit a site on our browser, a request is made to the server for the resources to render the corresponding web page (HTML, style sheets, scripts, images, etc).  In server side rendering, the response to this is a fully rendered HTML that will be then displayed on the user browser. This means that all the scripts that are needed to generate the content of the page (say, customized content for each user) will be compiled on the server. The final HTML that is to be displayed will be returned from the server to the client browser. In client side rendering, the server returns the boilerplate HTML document along with the Javascript files that will render the rest of the content on the client browser. The HTML  document contains the basic necessary static wrapper for the site. The dynamic content of the pages will be rendered by the Javascript running on the client browser. The use of client side rendering became popular with introduction of powerful Javascript libraries like React.js, Angular and Vue.js.

### Only Update What’s Necessary

 In SSR, each time we visit a new page on the website, the browser makes a new request to the server. It does not matter if the new page has only a few sections different from the current page, the browser will make a request for the new page and re-render it from scratch. For example, most web sites have a common navigation bar and footer for all the pages. In SSR, the resources to render these components will be requested each time a new page on the site is visited. It does not matter if the resources are already present on the browser. This slows down user experience, increases server load and prevents use of the application when the user is disconnected from the server. 
In CSR, all the reources/scripts required to render all the pages are loaded in advance during the first request. Thus, subsequest navigation in the site does not involve requesting for the same resources again from the server. For example, if a page contains a link to display new additional content, the browser does not make a new request to the server. Instead the JS libraries will load the new content and only that is rendered, leaving the other sections untouched. 

### Load time difference

Web page load time refers to the time between making a request to the server and the content getting rendered on the browser. The way the web pages are rendered differs in the SSR and CSR appraoches, thus the load time differs as well. During the first load, SSR requests a pre-compiled HTML document whereas in CSR the HTML, style sheets and the scripts required are first downloaded and then compiled on the browser, thus it is relatively slower compared to SSR. However, for the subsequent pages, the complete request cycle is repeated in SSR. CSR does not have to make further requests since it has all the scripts loaded in advance and is thus faster.
