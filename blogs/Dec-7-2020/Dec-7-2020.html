    <h1 id="client-side-and-server-side-rendering">Client-side and server-side Rendering</h1>
    <p>The traditional method for fetching and rendering content on the browser has always been server-side rendering.It was the most suitable method back then since most content on the web were static text and images, with very
        minimal user interactivity. Over the years, web applications have become more complex and provide a wide range
        of user interactions. They are no longer static sites, but rather full end applications that can be used to
        shop, submit forms, chat, etc.

    <blockquote>
        <p><em>Server rendering generates the full HTML for a page on the server in response to navigation. This avoids
                additional round-trips for data fetching and templating on the client, since it’s handled before the
                browser gets a response. Client-side rendering (CSR) means rendering pages directly in the browser using
                JavaScript. All logic, data fetching, templating and routing are handled on the client rather than the
                server.</em> <br>

    </blockquote>
    <p>When we visit a site on our browser, a request is made to the server for the resources to render the
        corresponding web page (HTML, style sheets, scripts, images, etc). In server side rendering, the response to
        this is a fully rendered HTML that will be then displayed on the user browser. This means that all the scripts
        that are needed to generate the content of the page (say, customized content for each user) will be compiled on
        the server. The final HTML that is to be displayed will be returned from the server to the client browser. In
        client side rendering, the server returns the boilerplate HTML document along with the Javascript files that
        will render the rest of the content on the client browser. The HTML document contains the basic necessary static
        wrapper for the site. The dynamic content of the pages will be rendered by the Javascript running on the client
        browser. The use of client side rendering became popular with introduction of powerful Javascript libraries like
        React.js, Angular and Vue.js.</p>

    <h2 id="only-update-whats-necessary">Only Update What’s Necessary</h2><hr>
    <p>In SSR, each time we visit a new page on the website, the browser makes a new request to the server. It does not
        matter if the new page has only a few sections different from the current page, the browser will make a request
        for the new page and re-render it from scratch. For example, most web sites have a common navigation bar and
        footer for all the pages. In SSR, the resources to render these components will be requested each time a new
        page on the site is visited. It does not matter if the resources are already present on the browser. This slows
        down user experience, increases server load and prevents use of the application when the user is disconnected
        from the server.
        In CSR, all the reources/scripts required to render all the pages are loaded in advance during the first
        request. Thus, subsequest navigation in the site does not involve requesting for the same resources again from
        the server. For example, if a page contains a link to display new additional content, the browser does not make
        a new request to the server. Instead the JS libraries will load the new content and only that is rendered,
        leaving the other sections untouched.</p>
    <h2 id="load-time-difference">Difference in load time</h2><hr>
    <p>Web page load time refers to the time between making a request to the server and the content getting rendered on
        the browser. The way the web pages are rendered differs in the SSR and CSR appraoches, thus the load time
        differs as well. During the first load, SSR requests a pre-compiled HTML document whereas in CSR the HTML, style
        sheets and the scripts required are first downloaded and then compiled on the browser, thus it is relatively
        slower compared to SSR. However, for the subsequent pages, the complete request cycle is repeated in SSR. CSR
        does not have to make further requests since it has all the scripts loaded in advance and is thus faster.</p>
